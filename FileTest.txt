You can directly input a URL into the editor and JSONLint will scrape it for JSON and parse it.
You can provide JSON to lint in the URL if you link to JSONLint with the "json" parameter. Here's an example URL to test.
JSONLint can also be used as a JSON compressor if you add ?reformat=compress to the URL.
